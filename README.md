# pyBankBDA
Python scripts for massaging Bermudian Bank .csv files 
then categorizing them based on the description (and hopefully transaction amount too)

## currently requires 
    pandas

Will eventually extend it out to conduct budget tracking based on categorized transactions.

### Notes
- IRL Butterfield.csv file has 2 columns for first 3 rows. I just addeed columns so that it looks pretty on github.
